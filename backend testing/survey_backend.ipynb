    "# Testing LLM Capabilities for Convey - An Interactive Survey Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for our project in building an interactive survey interface. We'll focus on the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)\n",
    "- Implementing and fine-tuning RAG for tasks such as responding and asking follow-up questions to users in a personalised manner.\n",
    "- Exploring RAG's ability to provide relevant product-specific responses based on retrieval from a knowledge source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- Crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM's responses.\n",
    "- Experimenting with different prompt formats and strategies to optimise performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Vector Store Manipulation\n",
    "- Manipulating vector stores to enhance the understanding and generation capabilities of the LLM.\n",
    "- Examining the impact of vector store modifications on the quality and relevance of generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use this notebook to test various features and functionalities provided by the LLM and assess its suitability for the Convey platform."
